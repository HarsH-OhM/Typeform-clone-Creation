# Typeform-clone-Creation
#Template for online survey forms
#HTML5 #css #jquery #materialize css for design #Zapeir Integration #digital-signature pad
In this project i have made a feedback survey form in which i have added some really good features like digital-signature pad, star rating, rating scale and other required input fields. so its like a clone of  typeform or paperform which we use for survey and all other things. i have added the email integration also by integrating Zapier addon so that we can send the form data to the users mail id after the submission. i have made this by using html css and jquery  only which is the best thing about it because we are not using any server side language for digital signature  and for form data submission part.
